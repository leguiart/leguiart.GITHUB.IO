        <h2>Internet of Things</h2>
        <p>In the broadest sense, the term IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that "talk" to each other.
        "Simply, the Internet of Things is made up of devices - from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables - connected together,"
        Matthew Evans, the IoT programme head at techUK, says. </p>
        <p>By combining these connected devices with automated systems, it is possible to "gather information, analyse it and create an action" to help someone with a particular task, or learn from a process.
          In reality, this ranges from smart mirrors to beacons in shops and beyond. </p>
        <p>"It's about networks, it's about devices, and it's about data," Caroline Gorski, the head of IoT at Digital Catapult explains.
          IoT allows devices on closed private internet connections to communicate with others and "the Internet of Things brings those networks together.
          It gives the opportunity for devices to communicate not only within close silos but across different networking types and creates a much more connected world." </p>

        <h2>5G</h2>
        <p>5G networks are the next generation of mobile internet connectivity, offering faster speeds and more reliable connections on smartphones and other devices than ever before.          </p>
        <p>Combining cutting-edge network technology and the very latest research, 5G should offer connections that are multitudes faster than current connections, with average download speeds of around 1GBps expected to soon be the norm.</p>
        <p>The networks will help power a huge rise in Internet of Things technology, providing the infrastructure needed to carry huge amounts of data, allowing for a smarter and more connected world.</p>
